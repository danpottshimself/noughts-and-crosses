They can either be drawn or objects resembling these two options can be used. In giant noughts and crosses for example, the two objects are the noughts and crosses themselves.</li> <li>The player with the Xs starts the game by positioning his X in a square. The player with the Os follows and both players take turns to move and occupy the squares of the grid trying to make a row of three and at the same time also block their opponent.</li><li>In Noughts and Crosses the opening player has a slight advantage so it is advisable to alternate who starts first in order to keep the games fair. There is only a maximum of nine moves in any game so due to the speed and brevity of a Noughts and Crosses game, every turn counts.</li><li>Despite the simple form of Noughts and Crosses it has been calculated that there are in excess of 255,168 possible layouts on the board. However it is a very simple game to play and because of this Noughts and Crosses is a very popular game for children. The giant noughts and crosses board is particularly fun to use, and especially for children.</li>');
